## Why this Project?

Pick up higher-level problem solving skills and dive deeper into writing functional Javascript using the better parts of ES6/ES7 by making a real-time action game. 

## Game Logic

This is a bare-bones implementation of a classic shooting game called Space Invaders. The player must shoot all the invaders before they reach the player to win. The invaders randomly keep shooting and slowly move towards the player. 

## Approach

Drawing on the canvas, the game loop, and collision detection are all done without any libraries or frameworks. This project was written in a functional programming style using ideas borrowed from Clojure's immutable data structures.
