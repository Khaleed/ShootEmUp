This is my own implementation of a classic shooting game called Space Invaders. The player must shoot all the invaders before they reach the player to win. The invaders randomly keep shooting the player and slowly move towards the player. 

This my first ever real-time action game using JavaScript ES6/ES7. Drawing on the canvas, collision detection, game loop and key inputs are all done without using any libraries or game engines.

The main goals behind this project were to pick up higher-level problem solving skills that involve thinking more about time and space. Also, to learn more about functional programming in JavaScript using the better parts of ES6/ES7.
